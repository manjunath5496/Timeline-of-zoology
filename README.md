This fierce beast was the last major food animal to be tamed for use as a source of milk, meat, power, and leather in the&nbsp;<a title="Old World" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World">Old World</a>.</li>
<li>3500 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Sumer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumerian</a>&nbsp;animal-drawn wheeled vehicles and plows are developed in&nbsp;<a title="Mesopotamia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the region called the "<a title="Fertile Crescent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a>" by U.S. archaeologist&nbsp;<a title="James Henry Breasted" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Henry_Breasted">James Henry Breasted</a>&nbsp;(1865&ndash;1935).&nbsp;<a title="Irrigation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation">Irrigation</a>&nbsp;may also have used animal power. By increasing the area under cultivation and reducing the number of people required to raise food, society will permit a few people to become priests, artisans, scholars, and merchants. Since Sumeria had no natural defenses, armies with mounted&nbsp;<a title="Cavalry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry">cavalry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Chariot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot">chariots</a>&nbsp;became imperative and were a scourge upon the land they purported to protect. Civilization was thus built on the backs of equines (<a title="Horse" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse">horses</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Donkey" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey">asses</a>).</li>
<li>2000 BC. Domestication of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Silkworm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkworm">silkworm</a>&nbsp;in China.</li>
<li>1100 BC. Won Chang (China), first of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Zhou Dynasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty">Chou</a>&nbsp;emperors, stocked his imperial&nbsp;<a title="Zoo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo">zoological garden</a>&nbsp;with deer, goats, birds and fish from many parts of the world. Like zoos today, the animals may have been seen as exotic, alien, and possibly threatening. The emperor also enjoyed sporting events with the use of animals.</li>
<li>850 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Homer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>&nbsp;(<a title="Greeks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks">Greek</a>), reputedly a blind poet, wrote the epics&nbsp;<a title="Iliad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad">Iliad</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Odyssey" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. Both contain animals as&nbsp;<a title="Monster" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster">monsters</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Metaphor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor">metaphors</a>&nbsp;(gross soldiers turned into pigs by the witch&nbsp;<a title="Circe" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circe">Circe</a>), but also some correct observations on bees and fly maggots. Both epics make reference to&nbsp;<a title="Mule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule">mules</a>. The ancient Greeks considered horses so highly that they "hybridized" them with humans, to form boisterous&nbsp;<a title="Centaur" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur">centaurs</a>. At any rate, animals are used as metaphors and moral symbols by Homer to make a timeless story.</li>
<li>610 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Anaximander" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">Anaximander</a>&nbsp;(Greek, 610 BC&ndash;545 BC) was a student of&nbsp;<a title="Thales of Miletus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Thales of Miletus</a>. The first life, he taught, was formed by&nbsp;<a title="Spontaneous generation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation">spontaneous generation</a>&nbsp;in the mud. Later animals came into being by transmutations, left the water, and reached dry land. Man was derived from lower animals, probably aquatic. His writings, especially his poem&nbsp;<em>On Nature</em>, were read and cited by&nbsp;<a title="Aristotle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&nbsp;and other later philosophers, but are lost.</li>
<li>563? BC.&nbsp;<a title="Gautama Buddha" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha</a>&nbsp;(Indian, 563?&ndash;483 BC) had gentle ideas on the treatment of animals. Animals are held to have intrinsic worth, not just the values they derive from their usefulness to man.</li>
<li>500 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Empedocles" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles">Empedocles</a>&nbsp;of Agrigentum (Greek, 504&ndash;433 BC) reportedly rid a town of&nbsp;<a title="Malaria" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria">malaria</a>&nbsp;by draining nearby swamps. He proposed the theory of the four humors and a natural origin of living things.</li>
<li>500 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Alcmaeon of Croton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmaeon_of_Croton">Alcmaeon</a>&nbsp;(Greek, c. 500 BC) performed human dissections. He identified the optic nerve, distinguished between veins and arteries, and showed that the nose was not connected to the brain. He made much of the tongue and explained how it functioned. He also gave an explanation for semen and for sleep.</li>
<li>500 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Xenophanes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a>&nbsp;(Greek, 576&ndash;460 BC), a disciple of&nbsp;<a title="Pythagoras" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>&nbsp;(?&ndash;497 BC), first recognized fossils as animal remains and inferred that their presence on mountains indicated the latter had once been beneath the sea. "If horses or oxen had hands and could draw or make statues, horses would represent the forms of gods as horses, oxen as oxen."&nbsp;<a title="Galen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen">Galen</a>&nbsp;(130?&ndash;201?) revived interest in fossils that had been rejected by Aristotle, and the speculations of Xenophanes were again viewed with favor.</li>
<li>470 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Democritus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus">Democritus</a>&nbsp;of Abdera (Greek, 470&ndash;370 BC) made dissections of many animals and humans. He was the first Greek philosopher-scientist to propose a classification of animals, dividing them into blooded animals (Vertebrata) and bloodless animals (Evertebrata). He also held that lower animals had perfected organs and that the brain was the seat of thought.</li>
<li>460 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Hippocrates" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>&nbsp;(Greek, 460?&ndash;377? BC), the "Father of Medicine", used animal dissections to advance human anatomy. Fifty books attributed to him were assembled in Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. These probably represent the works of several authors, but the treatments given are usually conservative.</li>
<li>440 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Herodotus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>&nbsp;of Halikarnassos (Greek, 484&ndash;425 BC) treated exotic fauna in his&nbsp;<em>Historia</em>, but his accounts are often based on tall tales. He explored the Nile, but much of ancient Egyptian civilization was already lost to living memory by his time.</li>
<li>384 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Aristotle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&nbsp;(Greek, 384&ndash;322 BC) studied under&nbsp;<a title="Plato" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a>, but he was not reluctant to disagree with the master. His books&nbsp;<em><a title="History of Animals" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Animals">Historia Animalium</a></em>&nbsp;(9 books),&nbsp;<em><em lang="la" title="Latin language text">De Partibus Animalium</em></em>, and&nbsp;<em><em lang="la" title="Latin language text">De Generatione Animalium</em></em>&nbsp;set the zoological stage for centuries. He emphasized the value of direst observation, recognized law and order in biological phenomena, and derived conclusions inductively from observed facts. He believed that there was a natural scale that ran from simple to complex. He made advances in the area of marine biology, basing his writings on keen observation and rational interpretation as well as conversations with local Lesbos fishermen for two years, beginning in 344 BC. His account of male protection of eggs by the barking catfish was scorned for centuries until Louis Agassiz confirmed Aristotle's description. Aristotle's botanical works are lost, but those of his botanical student&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Theophrastos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastos">Theophrastos</a>&nbsp;of Eresos (372&ndash;288 BC) are still available (<em>Inquiry into Plants</em>).</li>
<li>340 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Plato" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a>&nbsp;(Greek, 427&ndash;347 BC) held that animals existed to serve man, but they should not be mistreated because this would lead people to mistreat other people. Others who have echoed this opinion are St.&nbsp;<a title="Thomas Aquinas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Immanuel Kant" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Albert Schweitzer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>.</li>
<li>323 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Alexander the Great" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</a>&nbsp;(Macedonian, 356&ndash;323 BC) collected animals, some perhaps for his old teacher Aristotle, when he was not busy conquering the known world. He is credited with the introduction of the peacock into Europe. Aside from its decorative tail feathers, the peacock (a pheasant) was eaten regularly by Europeans until the arrival of the turkey. (<a title="Charlemagne" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>&nbsp;is said to have served thousands at a single bash.)</li>
<li>95 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Lucretius" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius">Lucretius</a>&nbsp;(Titus Lucretius Carus) (Roman, 96?&ndash;55 BC) spent his whole life writing one poem (still unfinished), called&nbsp;<em>De Rerum Natura</em>, with a version of the atomic theory, a theory of heredity, etc.</li>
<li>70 BC. Publius Vergilius Maro (<a title="Virgil" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a>) (70&ndash;19 BC) was a famous Roman poet. His poems&nbsp;<em>Bucolics</em>&nbsp;(42&ndash;37 BC) and&nbsp;<em>Georgics</em>&nbsp;(37&ndash;30 BC) hold much information on animal husbandry and farm life. His&nbsp;<em>Aeneid</em>&nbsp;(published posthumously) has many references to the zoology of his time.</li>
<li>36 BC. Marcus Terentius&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Varro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varro">Varro</a>&nbsp;(116&ndash;27 BC) wrote&nbsp;<em><em lang="la" title="Latin language text">De Re Rustica</em></em>, a treatise that includes apiculture. He also treated the problem of sterility in the mule and recorded a rare instance in which a fertile mule was bred.</li>
<li>50.&nbsp;<a title="Seneca the Younger" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">Lucius Annaeus Seneca</a>&nbsp;(Roman, 4 BC&ndash;AD 65), tutor to Roman emperor&nbsp;<a title="Nero" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero">Nero</a>, maintained that animals have no reason, just instinct, a "stoic" position. He remarked on the ability of glass globes filled with water to magnify small objects.</li>
<li>77.&nbsp;<a title="Pliny the Elder" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>&nbsp;(Roman, 23&ndash;79) wrote his&nbsp;<em><em lang="la" title="Latin language text"><a title="Natural History (Pliny)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)">Historia Naturalis</a></em></em>&nbsp;in 37 volumes. This work is a catch-all of zoological folklore, superstitions, and some good observations.</li>
<li>79.&nbsp;<a title="Pliny the Younger" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>&nbsp;(Roman, 62&ndash;113), nephew of Pliny the Elder, inherited his uncle's notes and wrote on beekeeping.</li>
<li>100.&nbsp;<a title="Plutarch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch">Plutarch</a>&nbsp;(Roman, 46?&ndash;120) stated that animals' behavior is motivated by reason and understanding. Life of the ant mirrors the virtues of friendship, sociability, endurance, courage, moderation, prudence, and justice.</li>
<li>131.&nbsp;<a title="Galen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen">Galen</a>&nbsp;of Pergamum (Greek, 131?&ndash;201?), physician to Roman Emperor&nbsp;<a title="Marcus Aurelius" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>, wrote on human anatomy from dissections of animals. His texts were used for hundreds of years, gaining the reputation of infallibility.</li>

Various compilers in post-classical and medieval times added to the&nbsp;<em><em lang="la" title="Latin language text"><a title="Physiologus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologus">Physiologus</a></em></em>&nbsp;(or, more popularly, the&nbsp;<em>Bestiary</em>), the major book on animals for hundreds of years. Animals were believed to exist in order to serve man, if not as food or slaves then as moral examples.</li>
